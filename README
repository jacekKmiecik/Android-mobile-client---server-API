The Android app and the server API are part of my BSc thesis project submitted in December 2011. The two modules are a meant to be used for a vehicle fleet management system. This code was written entirely be me during my last semester of bachelor Computer Science studies at the Gdansk University of Technology. Please note that I only had three months during a busy semester to complete this project, so it might have some minor flaws.

Contents description:
- AndroidClient - folder containing the native Android app (for fleet's drivers), it's a project in Eclipse IDE
- client screenshots - here you can find some screenshots of the app (ran in the emulator)
- server API - web services written in PHP for interaction between the app and the server
- client class model.png - an UML class diagram of the Android app

If you have any questions or would like to re-use my code, feel free to contact me.
